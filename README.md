## Usage
```python3 pdf_encoder.py [pdf to encode] [downloader page name]```

## How it works
### Host:
![dev dia](imgs/jamdev.jpg)
* Run the python tool for each target pdf. The tool generates a _/[downloader page].html_ and a single _/[reader].html_
* Then all the host has to do is put the newly generated HTML in their web server and share the URL.

### User:
![user dia](imgs/jamuser.jpg)
* User visits _/[downlaoder page].html_  and on that page the pdf will be saved in their indexDB cache
* Then it will redirect the user to the _/[reader].html_ page where all the saved PDF's can be easy read and managed.

### Output Description

**reader .html file:**

 * This is also the page that will be cached, so the user can come back to this page offline for reading at anytime.

**.readerName:**
